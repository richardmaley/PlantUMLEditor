This is a windows application that edits PlantUML diagrams.  I am using Delphi 12.  It is Delphi/Pascal code.  It also uses the TEdgeBrowser, consequently it needs the WebView2Loader.dll.

Installation: Install this application in its own directory because the executable creates its required subdirectories when first run.
A directory called Images will be created to house PlantUml diagrams.  In the Images directory there is a subdirectory called Examples.  It has multiple *.puml examples.
